# Analog Film Shaders for OpenMW
Film Style Shaders for OpenMW

hese are three shaders I made to try to get a more analog film look to my Morrowind, without resorting to reshade which applies to the entire UI.

**Multi-Lut**
The multi-LUT shader has 40 different film preset based LUTs that allow you to apply a variety of different color styles to your game. It allows using two different LUTs at once and adjusting the magnitudes so you can blend them together. The shader is split into an exterior and interior version so you can have separate interior and exterior settings.

Eventually I'll add a guide that will explain how to make your own LUTs in lightroom and how to change the LUT pallete provided to your own.

**Halation**
A simple halation shader that applies a red glow around highlights. You can adjust this to apply around nearly anything or only very blown out highlights.
Very customizable, default settings are somewhat subtle, but in general this was mostly designed for taking screenshots with the settings tweaked for your specific image.

**Chromatic Aberration
**A simple chromatic abberation shader. Pretty straightforward.

Feel free to do whatever with these. They're mainly for personal use trying to make it so I didn't need to use Reshade shaders. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or issues.

CREDITS:
ï»¿Huge thanks to xerofoxx for their LUT shader, and Epoch for porting it to OpenMW and helping me get started with OpenMW shaders. The Multi-Lut is based off of Epoch's port of Xero-Lut from MGE-XE.
